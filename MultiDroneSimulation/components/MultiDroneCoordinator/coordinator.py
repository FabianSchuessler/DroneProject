THIS IS A LAST MINUTE SCRIPT, IT MAY CONTAIN REALLY BAD CODE STRUCTURE AND ALMOST NO DOCUMENTATION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

some parts where taken from the following dronekit example:

	Â© Copyright 2015-2016, 3D Robotics.
	simple_goto.py: GUIDED mode "simple goto" example (Copter Only)

	Demonstrates how to arm and takeoff in Copter and how to navigate to points using Vehicle.simple_goto.
