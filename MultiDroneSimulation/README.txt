This folder is set up to
	launch 2 (or more) simulated drones, (for more you have to create new clones of the ardupilot repo in components/Simulation/)
	show them in 3D using flightgear
	show them on a map using my own Groundstation or QGroundControl

My own Groundstation shows how 2 Drones can work together by dynamically distributing tasks (flying along lines) to them.

This was not really tested a lot, so I guess it works only on the PC of the developer. :(
But if you try to get it to work on your machine and need help just send me a mail:
