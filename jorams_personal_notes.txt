This file contains my raw unpolished notes that I took while working on this project.
I took my time to translate things that were originally in German, but thats all...

ArduPilot AutoPilot (apm-copter-erlebrain)
	Autopilot Software
	running on AV
	reads sensors and uses them to hold drone in air (constantly regulating motor speeds, ...)
	can get requests/commands from different sources:
	- RC
		throttle down when starting
		throttle down right to arm motors
		throttle down left to disarm motors
	- Ground Station over telemetry
	Flight modes
		- stabilize
		- alt(itude) hold
		- loiter
		- follow me, descend, return to launch (RTL)
		- auto mode -> run complex missions defined by ground station
		
Safety equipment:
	large towel to throw over the drone after crash or in emergency situations
	fire extinguisher
	first aid kit


Problems and Solutions:
		how about flashing other image?
	creating network connection
		nmcli -> doesn't work
		writing to /etc/network/something.conf -> does work
	downloading software key doesn't work
		in virtual machine test whether keydownload may work
		connect drone to network where it works :)
	ssh to drone 
		use ifconfig to get ip
		over ethernet -> works somewhat
		over wlan -> doesn't work
	internet access for drone
		over ethernet -> works, if computer is configured to share inet over ethernet
		over wlan -> edit files
	QGroundControl looses connection when RC is connected as well
	GPS not working
		http://forum.erlerobotics.com/t/no-gps-fix-on-erle-brain-3/3041
		http://forum.erlerobotics.com/t/gps-not-working-erle-brain-3/2229
		may just be broken
		... or you just have to go outside and be patient... that seemed to fix it (facepalm)
	Telemetry not working anymore
		Did something physically break? (cable, etc.)
		-> no the config just got screewed up (see hardware_components.md on how to fix)
	Drone needs parameters to be set after flashing image
		https://github.com/erlerobot/erle_parameters/blob/master/copter/Frambuesa-29-09-2017-default.param
	Coreflight doesn't compile: fatal error: bits/libc-header-start.h: No such file or directory
		 $ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

	git recursive clone or submodule update times out
		The native git protocol uses port 443 for the main repo and port 9418 for the submodules. If this port is firewalled on the network, recursive clone times out and fails.
		Workaround: git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/
	Radio will start beeping after a while when it is connected but you don't use it
		just do something on it like clicking ok to stop that (temporarily)

QGroundControl is working over telemetry
Radio and Groundcontrol have to be on before booting the drone

sudo su
systemctl (stop|start|disable|enable|status) (apm.service|xp4.service)
screen /dev/ttyS0 (if some strange symbols occcur than GPS is working ... with correctly specified baudrate there may even be readable text)
adding sleep 10 to apm.sh

What we need:
	cardreader, ethernet adapter
	String
	Glue
	¡¡¡SHORT MICROUSBCABLE!!!

something about ublox center
	http://forum.erlerobotics.com/t/gps-tutorial-how-to-address-a-no-fix/1009
rostopics for debugging
	http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic

what happens if you interrupt missions?
are missions uploaded or send command by command
	possible to upload missions
	replanning?
	heterogenious multiple UAVs

what commands/tasks can a mission have?
	depends on vehicle, here is a list for the drone
	http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/mission-command-list.html

coreflight todo?
	look at available/used topics
	who is comminicating with whom, sensor readings, ...
	-> look at events, define monitor that gives alarms etc.,
	traces of correct behaviour (event streams)

what happens if you deactivate a motor
	https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/838#issuecomment-70080427

Plan of action:
	install cfs
	get as many sensor data as possible
	-> preferably life
		create proxy for telemetry
		tracing
			common trace format   https://diamon.org/ctf/
			tracing for ardupilot http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-linux-trace-toolkit-ng-lttng-to-trace-ardupilot-in-realtime.html
			babeltrace LTTng stuf https://lttng.org/viewers/

	Extending QGroundControl for Automated Mission Planning of UAVs
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068744/
	ThingML?

Installing SITL -> see MultiDroneSimulation/README.txt for better info
	git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot
	cd ardupilot
	git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/		#to work around network restrictions
	git submodule update --init --recursive
	copy folder n times to ardupilot{n} in MultiDroneSimulation/components/Simulation (there are 2 empty folders for reference)
	ardupilot0/ArduCopter/config		-> replace MAV_SYSTEM_ID in additional folders
	export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/ardupilot/Tools/autotest
	./waf configure --board sitl
	./waf --targets bin/arducopter		-> do this step only once you got all copies of ardupilot you need

multiple SITL-Instances with one Groundstation?
-> finally working! Hurray

How can we coordinate those instances?
	showing them in different windows
	showing them on common map with qgroundcontrol
	doing stuff with them?
	
	Goal: Write HVL on the fjord!

Drones as a social group: where do we meet again if we get lost, who is going to do what, if youre going over there, can you do this or that for me

(Also there is a physical piece of paper with more notes on code structure and used ports somewhere by the drone)
